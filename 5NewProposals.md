In X, Dr Sun Yatsen made 5 proposals for modern China.

I found his thinking to be very lucid and clear.

In my small way, I have tried to copy his framework, and make 5 proposals for 2022. 

Successes...

We are half way to a civilization. Look around, at the triumphs of engineering.

- We have hot water, and heating for the winter. 
- We have communication networks, staffed by competent engineers. 
- We can obtain and herb ir medicine in our local shop. 

Truly, there are many triumphs. But where shall we go from here?


Before listening to these proposals, bear in mind two things:

1) This is not empty, hot air, these networks are already being made by . X industry xxx.
2) This has nothing to do with politics. This is about engineering, which goes beyond politics. 

I propose

- A microfinance network, scalable, easy to set up, looks beautiful, fast and useful.

2 - I propose we take the weight off the earth by helping people raise ducks, chickems,. goats and other animals in their back yard. 

3 - I propose we attempt to provide some of our energy at a homestead level. 

4 - I propose we get water from the air. 

5 - I propose we build new, villages towns and cities. 

These are not empty proposals. The 

People often focus on polticis. This is not my concern right now. 

Consider the bridges, palaces, and schoolyards of today. Who were

Will freedom come from politics, maybe? When we think of freedom, we are conditioned to look to the polticians... 

In my view, freedom starts from the home. A house that can provide pure water using innovative technology. A house that provides healthy food.

CAn we acheive 100% freedom? Of course not, 

How much of my drinking water comes from the air? Right now, zero percent. In 3 months, I hope to provide 3 liters a day from the air. That is a reasonable goal. It is a scalable goal. It is a goal that others can copy. 

You may tell yourself I am a 

In return, I tell myself you are an inneffective loudmouth. Engineers work with stone and iron. 


Deeper into each
