In X, Dr Sun Yatsen made proposals for modern China.

I therefore propose a plan for the organisation of a new market in China, sufficiently 
extensive both to develop China's productive forces and to absorb the industrial capacity of the foreign Powers. The 
plan I propose is as follows : 

1. The development of systems of communication : 

(a) 100,000 miles of railways. 

(b) 1,000,000 miles of roads. 

(c) Improvement of existing canals : 

(i) Hangchow- Tientsin, 
(ii) Sinkiang-Yangtse. 

(d) Construction of new canals : 

(i) Liaoyang-Shanghai-kwan. 
(ii) Canals to be planned. 

(e) Organisation of China's river system : 

(i) Clearing and deepening the bed of 
the river Yangtse, from Hankow to 
the sea, in order to permit of ocean- 
going vessels reaching Hankow. 

I found his thinking to be very lucid and clear.

100 years later. We have a different landscape. In my small way, I have tried to copy his framework, and make 5 proposals for 2022. 

We now have all the railroad and canals we need.

Successes...

We are half way to a civilization. Look around, at the triumphs of engineering.

- We have hot water, and heating for the winter. 
- We have communication networks, staffed by competent engineers. 
- We can obtain any herb or medicine in our local shop. 
- Our transporation networks are reasonable and safe. 
- We have an egalitarian, online education system, which is low priced, or free. 

Truly, there are many triumphs. But where shall we go from here? Many movies warn us of the dangers of too much technology. Could technology end up trapping us?

Before listening to these proposals, bear in mind two things:

1) This is not empty, hot air, these networks are already being made by . X industry xxx.
2) This has nothing to do with politics. This is about engineering, which goes beyond politics. 

I propose

1 - An open source microfinance network, scalable, easy to set up, looks beautiful, fast and useful.

2 - We take the weight off the earth by helping people raise ducks, chickems,. goats and other animals in their back yard. 

3 - We attempt to provide some of our energy at a homestead level. 

4 - We get water from the air. 

5 - We build new, villages towns and cities. 

These are not empty proposals. The infrastructure is already being built now. Commerical units are available. Also, many people are using ingenuity to find solutions. 

Pioneers in these inudsties may be able to make money. 

SHOW THEM ALL THE COOL STUFF. OVERVIEW. 

People often focus on polticis. This is not my concern right now. 

Consider the bridges, palaces, and schoolyards of today. Who were

Will freedom come from politics, maybe? When we think of freedom, we are conditioned to look to the polticians... 

In my view, freedom starts from the home. A house that can provide pure water using innovative technology. A house that provides healthy food.

CAn we acheive 100% freedom? Of course not, 

How much of my drinking water comes from the air? Right now, zero percent. In 3 months, I hope to provide 3 liters a day from the air. That is a reasonable goal. It is a scalable goal. It is a goal that others can copy. 

You may tell yourself I am a 

In return, I tell myself you are an inneffective loudmouth. Engineers work with stone and iron. 


Deeper into each
